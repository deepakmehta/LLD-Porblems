Stack Overflow is one of the largest online communities for developers to learn and share their knowledge.
The website provides a platform for its users to ask and answer questions,
and through membership and active participation,
to vote questions and answers up or down.
Users can edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki.

Users of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and badges.
For example, a person is awarded ten reputation points for receiving an “up” vote on an answer and five points for the “up” vote of a question. The can also receive badges for their valued contributions. A higher reputation lets users unlock new privileges like the ability to vote, comment on, and even edit other people’s posts.

Requirements and Goals of the System#
We will be designing a system with the following requirements:

* Any non-member (guest) can search and view questions. However, to add or upvote a question, they have to become a member.
* Members should be able to post new questions.
* Members should be able to add an answer to an open question.
* Members can add comments to any question or answer.
* A member can upvote a question, answer or comment.
* Members can flag a question, answer or comment, for serious problems or moderator attention.
* Any member can add a bounty to their question to draw attention.
* Members will earn badges for being helpful.
* Members can vote to close a question; Moderators can close or reopen any question.
* Members can add tags to their questions. A tag is a word or phrase that describes the topic of the question.
* Members can vote to delete extremely off-topic or very low-quality questions.
* Moderators can close a question or undelete an already deleted question.
* The system should also be able to identify most frequently used tags in the questions.
